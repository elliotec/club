  <p class="type">Proposal</p>
  <h1>Proposal for Adobe Typekit Subscription</h1>
  <h2>We are proposing that 4Life Research initiate a subscription for the Adobe Typekit web font service so that the company can maintain professionalism and consistency with the corporate style guide in a legal manner.</h2>
  <p class="date">August 1, 2014</p>
  <h3>Consistency</h3>
  <p>We use Adobe FontFolio 11 for our fonts in print. The corporate style guide lists Futura, Galliard, and Caecilia as our company's preferred fonts, all of which you see in this proposal. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-licensing/font-embedding-permissions.html">End User License Agreement (EULA)</a> explicitly disallows the use of these fonts on the web:

  <blockquote>"Adobe’s current End-User License Agreement (EULA) for fonts does not permit font linking with @font-face using any font format, including, but not limited to, desktop (“raw”) fonts and the Web Open Font Format (WOFF). Adobe provides select Adobe Web Fonts for use on the web through the Adobe Typekit® web font service, where web font usage is governed by the Typekit service Terms of Use."</blockquote>

  This means that in order to legally use our corporate fonts on the web and maintain design consistency and professionalism in all our publications, we must subscribe to the Typekit web font service. 
  </p>

  <h3>Extensibile &amp; Scalable</h3>
  <p>With the new technologies that the web team has been using, such as <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a> and <a href="http://ionicframework.com">Ionic framework</a>, we can extend the Typekit library beyond just our internal and external websites, such as 4life.com, and onto native apps that use these web technologies like the forthcoming fitness app for iOS and Android. This circumvents the necessity to purchase a separate license for each native app, which would be the alternative if we were using the default technologies for these applications.</p>

  <h3>Dynamic</h3>
  <p>Adobe Typekit is one of the first services of its kind, and has become the industry de facto used by a huge portion of the web. As opposed to its free counterparts like Google Fonts, Typekit uses thousands (and counting) of professionally designed long standing fonts that are constantly improved and updated, and have been carefully optimized and hinted for all browsers, devices, screens and displays. It also has the benefit of supporting multiple languages and styles, an essential feature for our global market.</p>

  <p>Typekit is optimized for SEO because fonts remain as text rather than images so search engines can read them. This also means the fonts are unobtrusive, since we can dynamically modify any content without plugging them into images, etc. Its widely accessible for those with screen readers and reading devices, and the fonts are conveniently hosted on Adobe's CDN taking the load off our servers and our users' page load times. These features make it quite simple to implement, reducing development time.</p>

  <h3>In short</h3>
  <h6>We will remain consistent with the corporate style guide accross all products</h6>
  <h6>We will be able to use it in many languages and on mobile apps using web technologies</h6>
  <h6>The fonts are search engine and screen-reader friendly, and optimized for performance</h6>

  <h2>Pricing &amp; the Future</h2>

  <h3>Subscription Plans</h3>
  <p><a href="https://typekit.com/plans/business">The business level plan</a> has four tiers. We currently sit at about 4.5 million page views per month for all of 4life.com, putting us in the second tier at $100 per month up to 5 million page views. When we surpass 5 million page views per month, it should be a seamless transition to $200 per month up to 10 million page views. There are other plans that can extend this limit to ostensibly infinite amounts that can be discussed upon reaching that point.</p>

  <h3>Forecast</h3>

  <p>With the roll out of the new 4life.com and our continuous company growth,we can expect a steady surge in the number of unique and new users. This is a metric we want to increase in contrast to the number of unique page views. On the surface, higher page view numbers may seem like a good problem to have, but the reality is that these numbers are consistently generated by the same users, and increase load times for them and taxes on our servers (not to mention increasing the page view count will push us into new tiers in the Typekit subscription plan).</p>

  <%= image_tag "pageviewgraph.png" %>
  <p class="date">The number of pageviews slowly but steadily increases since the launch of the current 4life.com</p>

  <p>We have strategies in place to keep the numbers of page views down while increasing the rate of enrollment for new and unique users. Some of the aforementioned technologies like Angular.js will assist us greatly in this goal. However, the number of page views will naturally and inevitably increase as the company grows, more people visit our sites, and we enroll more distributors.</p>

  <%= image_tag "usersgraph.png" %>
  <p class="date">The number of newly registered users is growing, but we can expect a faster rate with the launch of the new website</p>

  <h3>In short</h3>
  <h6>Cost will be $100/month until we surpass the 5 million pageview threshold, at which point it will raise to $200/month</h6>
  <h6>We can keep the cost low by reducing pageviews while increasing new user sessions</h6>
  <h6>The new 4life.com rollout will allow us to see most of these changes quickly</h6>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>We, speaking on behalf of the web marketing team, believe that 4Life Research will greatly benefit from initiating and maintaining a subscription to the Adobe Typekit web font service for the reasons described above. We have a forecast and strategies being implemented to accomplish these goals.<p>
